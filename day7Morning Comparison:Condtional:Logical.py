#Comparison operators
    #comparison operators are Booleans whicih sre True/ off/ 
    #boolean Algebra -- Named after George Boole who was the first person to define an algebraic formula

#comparison operators:
    #4 > 9 - "4 is greater than 9" False
    #2 < 4 - "2 is less than 4" True
    #conditional operators check wherther a xcindition should evaluate to true or false
    #They do not have the same "truth value"
    # ">" Greater than
    # "<" Less than
    # ">=" Greater than or equal to
    # "<=" Less than or equal to
    # "==" Equal 
    

#Logical Operators in Python

    #The logical operators in PY are used to combine the True or False values of boolean variables
    #Figure out the their resultant truth value by using Logical operators available in Py.
        #AND - This returns True if both the operands(roght and left side) are true
        #OR - This returns Ture if teither of the oporands is true
        #NOT - This returns True if the operand is False

    #Examlpe 
        #how can we tell the differnce between the 2 exomples

#Breakdown
    #Step 1: (4>9) AND (2<4)
    #step 2: (False) AND (True)
    #step 3: By defintion of the AND compare the 2 above.
    #steo 4: False

# Conditional Statements
    #the control flow of your statement in computer is slection structure
    #the desicion is described to computer as a conditional statement that can be answered True or False
    #Py provifdes the following conditional statements:
        #If
        #If/Else
        #If/Elif/Else
        #Nested If/Else

    #The If statement
        #conditions are made in several ways: mostly in If statements and loops
        #It's a decisuion making statement. It is used to control the flow of eexecution of the statements and also used to test logicallywhether the condition is Ture or False
            #Why do you think I bolded the those 2 words
                #More than one answer
        #Need to indent just like with Def to definne the scpoe in the code. some programming languages often uyse {} for this purpose.
    #the Else statement 

    #the Elif statement
        #Elif goes between your If and Else statement
        #In other languages you can express it as Else If
        #this is known as a chain conditional
        #Cheained conditional;s allow more than two possibilites and need more than 2 branches to check for its resulting statement
        #You may have multiple Elif statements
        #You can use the Elif statement
        #The Elif keyword os Py way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition, before entering the else statement".

    #the Nested If /Else
        #It basically means to have something inside of something
            #An "If-elif-else" construct inside of another "If-Elif_Else" Construct
        #the more conditions you can get in the I/E/E statement the more info you can crunch
