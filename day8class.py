#Loops
    #an appliccation sometimes needs to perfirm repetitve actions like"     
        #getting sum of all the values in a list
        #getting the avertage of all the nums in list
        #entering multiple datat entry

#more loops
    #when a program repeatedly runs a set of statements. it is referred to as a loopm iteration or repetition structure
        #while loops
        #do-while loops
        #for loops
        #nested loops
    #"While loops" are knwon as conditional loops
    #"For loops" are known as counter controlles loops

#more on loops
    #loope=s are similar to conditionals because they run on a true?false value set
    #the loop continuously runs while the condition is true and terminates when it is false
    #loops can be run for a desired lenfth specified by you.


#how many lines of code are nedded for the followin( 
    #example

# myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]

# print(myList[0])
#     #this is to get a number by refernce

# print(type(myList))
#     #this willtell you what the tyoe is


#While-Loops
    #Awhile loop is a loop that is used to repeat a section of code an unkwonw number of time

# num = 5

# while(num == 5):
#     print("your number is 5")
 
#this is an infinite loop and can only be stopped by hitting "control c"

#counters
    #counters are variables that is incremented or decremented each time a loop repeatrs

#example

# sum = 0

# i = 1

# while(i <= 10):
#     sum = sum + i
#     i = i + 1
    
# print(sum)
# print(i)

#this was the way to get the sum of numbers 1 - 10 


# i = 0

# while(i < 15):
#     print(f"I'm in the while loop and it has run {i + 1} amount of times so far.")

#     i = i + 1

#for loops
    #for loops are ised to iterate ove a sequence , which could be a list, tuple, or string

    #for COUNTER in sequence:
        #statement1
        #statement2

#range()
    #you acan also specfiy the amount of time that you would likle to execute you statement int the loop using the range() function
    #the range function takes in several agurment
        #first argument represent whre thou would like 


#Declaring For Loops
    #in general a for loop has 3 components in the dec
        #1: initialing the index/counter
        #2: creating the condition
        #3: incrementation

for index in range(0,10):
    print(index)
